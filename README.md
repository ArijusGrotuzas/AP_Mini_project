A program that synthesizes guitar sounds and implements an Interface for playback of these sounds.
The user is capable of playing guitar notes: A1, B1, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2.
To play the corresponding sounds, user can press the buttons that look like guitar strings.
The programs buffer allows for playing multiple sounds without a cut-off, however playing many sounds in a rapid order can result in huge echo.
